Face Recognition-Based Attendance System
This project is a Face Recognition-Based Attendance System that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system is capable of recognizing faces, generating attendance slips, and sending emails to absentees. Additionally, it can generate QR codes for identification purposes.

Features
Face Recognition: Automatically detects and identifies faces from live video or uploaded images.
Attendance Marking: Marks attendance based on recognized faces and logs them into a database.
Slip Generation: Generates an attendance slip for each student, detailing the attendance status.
QR Code Generation: Creates QR codes for attendance verification.
Email Notifications: Automatically sends emails to students marked as absent.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (for face detection)
dlib (for face recognition)
Flask (if using a web-based interface)
Email server setup (for sending emails)
qrcode (for QR code generation)
